# Healthcare Integration Sim

This project simulates a basic healthcare integration pipeline using FHIR-formatted patient data, mock ingestion scripts, and error-handling documentation. It's designed to demonstrate key concepts relevant to system analysts and healthcare integration engineers, including:

- FHIR message validation
- Logging and error detection
- Workflow simulation
- Documentation for handoffs

ðŸš§ Work in progress â€“ actively adding modules weekly.
